SnowLand
========

###Description
SnowLand is an Android game based on the popular ["Ricochet Robots"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricochet_Robot) board game. Your goal is to get the princess to the purple tile, with the help of her two robots.
Ice is slippery, so the characters can only move in straight lines, stopping whenever they bump into an obstacle.
You can also challenge yourself to beat the computer's optimal solution!
The game has excellent replayability, since all maps are dynamically generated; you won't stumble upon the same puzzle twice.
